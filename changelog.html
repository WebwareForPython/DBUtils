</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-13">
<h2>1.1</h2>
<p>DBUtils 1.1 was released on August 14, 2011.</p>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The transparent reopening of connections is actually an undesired behavior
if it happens during database transactions. In these cases, the transaction
should fail and the error be reported back to the application instead of the
rest of the transaction being executed in a new connection and therefore in
a new transaction. Therefore DBUtils now allows suspending the transparent
reopening during transactions. All you need to do is indicate the beginning
of a transaction by calling the <span class="docutils literal">begin()</span> method of the connection.
DBUtils makes sure that this method always exists, even if the database
driver does not support it.</p></li>
<li><p>If the database driver supports a <span class="docutils literal">ping()</span> method, then DBUtils can use it
to check whether connections are alive instead of just trying to use the
connection and reestablishing it in case it was dead. Since these checks are
done at the expense of some performance, you have exact control when these
are executed via the new <span class="docutils literal">ping</span> parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">PooledDB</span> has got another new parameter <span class="docutils literal">reset</span> for controlling how
connections are reset before being put back into the pool.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fixed propagation of error messages when the connection was lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue with the <span class="docutils literal">setoutputsize()</span>  cursor method.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed some minor issues with the <span class="docutils literal">DBUtilsExample</span> for Webware.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-14">
<h2>1.0</h2>
<p>DBUtils 1.0 was released on November 29, 2008.</p>
<p>It is intended to be used with Python versions 2.2 to 2.6.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added a <span class="docutils literal">failures</span> parameter for configuring the exception classes for
which the failover mechanisms is applied (as suggested by Matthew Harriger).</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <span class="docutils literal">closeable</span> parameter for configuring whether connections can be
closed (otherwise closing connections will be silently ignored).</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to override defaults via the <span class="docutils literal">creator.dbapi</span> and
<span class="docutils literal">creator.threadsafety</span> attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an alias method <span class="docutils literal">dedicated_connection</span> as a shorthand for
<span class="docutils literal">connection(shareable=False)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a version attribute to all exported classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the value <span class="docutils literal">0</span> has the meaning &quot;unlimited&quot;, parameters can now be also
set to the value <span class="docutils literal">None</span> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>It turned out that <span class="docutils literal">threading.local</span> does not work properly with
<span class="docutils literal">mod_wsgi</span>, so we use the Python implementation for thread-local data
even when a faster <span class="docutils literal">threading.local</span> implementation is available.
A new parameter <span class="docutils literal">threadlocal</span> allows you to pass an arbitrary class
such as <span class="docutils literal">threading.local</span> if you know it works in your environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bugfixes and improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In some cases, when instance initialization failed or referenced objects
were already destroyed, finalizers could throw exceptions or create infinite
recursion (problem reported by Gregory Pinero and Jehiah Czebotar).</p></li>
<li><p>DBUtils now tries harder to find the underlying DB-API 2 module if only a
connection creator function is specified. This had not worked before with
the MySQLdb module (problem reported by Gregory Pinero).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>0.9.4</h2>
<p>DBUtils 0.9.4 was released on July 7, 2007.</p>
<p>This release fixes a problem in the destructor code and has been supplemented
with a German User's Guide.</p>
<p>Again, please note that the <span class="docutils literal">dbapi</span> parameter has been renamed to <span class="docutils literal">creator</span>
in the last release, since you can now pass custom creator functions
for database connections instead of DB-API 2 modules.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-16">
<h2>0.9.3</h2>
<p>DBUtils 0.9.3 was released on May 21, 2007.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support custom creator functions for database connections.
These can now be used as the first parameter instead of an DB-API module
(suggested by Ezio Vernacotola).</p></li>
<li><p>Added destructor for steady connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools">setuptools</a> if available.</p></li>
<li><p>Some code cleanup.</p></li>
<li><p>Some fixes in the documentation.
Added Chinese translation of the User's Guide, kindly contributed by gashero.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>0.9.2</h2>
<p>DBUtils 0.9.2 was released on September 22, 2006.</p>
<p>It is intended to be used with Python versions 2.2 to 2.5.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Renamed <span class="docutils literal">SolidDB</span> to <span class="docutils literal">SteadyDB</span> to avoid confusion with the &quot;solidDB&quot;
storage engine. Accordingly, renamed <span class="docutils literal">SolidPg</span> to <span class="docutils literal">SteadyPg</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-18">
<h2>0.9.1</h2>
<p>DBUtils 0.9.1 was released on May 8, 2006.</p>
<p>It is intended to be used with Python versions 2.2 to 2.4.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added <span class="docutils literal">_closeable</span> attribute and made persistent connections not closeable
by default. This allows <span class="docutils literal">PersistentDB</span>  to be used in the same way as you
would use <span class="docutils literal">PooledDB</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Allowed arguments in the DB-API 2 <span class="docutils literal">cursor()</span> method. MySQLdb is using this
to specify cursor classes. (Suggested by Michael Palmer.)</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the documentation and added a User's Guide.</p></li>
</ul>
