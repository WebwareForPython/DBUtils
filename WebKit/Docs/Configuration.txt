Command Line Configuration
==========================

Each of these can be set in the ``.config`` files, but they can be overridden
with the command line.  Run ``AppServer`` with switches in the form ``ClassName.SettingName=value``, e.g. ``AppServer.AdapterPort=8087``.

The ``value`` is coerced into a Python type: if it starts with one of the
characters ``({["'`` -- i.e., parenthesis (expression), dictionary, list,
or string -- then the value with be eval'ed.  If it can be turned into a
Boolean, integer, float or None, then it will be converted, otherwise it will
be left as a string.  Some examples:

* ``None`` == None
* ``True`` == True (evaluates to 1 in older Python versions)
* ``1`` == 1
* ``127.0.0.1`` == "127.0.0.1"
* ``(10+2)`` == 12
* ``{'a': 'b'}`` == {'a': 'b'}
* ``{a: b}`` == *error*
* ``[1, 'c', [2, 3]]`` == [1, 'c', [2, 3]]

Be careful about special characters in the shell.  All the characters
``() [] ' "`` are special, and need to be quoted (with ``\`` or with single
or double quotation marks).

Application.config
==================

``Application.config`` covers not only the application, but a number
of components that use it as a central point of configuration.

General Settings
----------------

``Contexts``:
    This dictionary maps context names to the directory holding the
    context content.  Since the default contexts all reside in WebKit,
    the paths are simple and relative.  The context name appears as the
    first path component of a URL, otherwise ``Contexts['default']``
    is used when none is specified.  When creating your own
    application, you will add a key such as ``"MyApp"`` with a value
    such as ``"/home/apps/MyApp"``.  That directory will then contain
    content such as Main.py, SomeServlet.py, SomePage.psp,
    etc.  ``Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py`` will set up a context for
    your use as well.  Default::

        {
            'default':   'Examples',
            'Admin':     'Admin',
            'Examples':  'Examples',
            'Docs':      'Docs',
            'Testing':   'Testing',
        }

``AdminPassword``:
    The password that, combined with the ``admin`` id, allows access
    to the ``AppControl`` page of the ``Admin`` context.  Set
    interactively when ``install.py`` is run (no default value).
``PrintConfigAtStartUp``:
    Print the configuration to the console when AppServer starts.
    Default: ``True`` (on).

Path Handling
-------------

These configuration settings control which files are exposed to users,
which files are hidden, and some of how those files get chosen.

``DirectoryFile``:
    The list of basic filenames that WebKit searches for when serving
    up a directory.  Note that the extensions are absent since WebKit
    will look for a file with any appropriate extension (``.py``.,
    ``.html``, ``.psp``, etc).  Default: ``["index", "Main"]``.
``ExtensionsToIgnore``:
    This is a list of extensions that WebKit will ignore when
    autodetecting extensions.  Note that this does not prevent WebKit
    from serving such a file if the extension is given explicitly in a
    URL.  Default: ``['.pyc', '.pyo', '.py~', '.bak']``.
``ExtensionsToServe``:
    This is a list of extensions that WebKit will use exclusively when
    autodetecting extensions.  Note that this does not prevent WebKit
    from serving such a file if it is named explicitly in a URL.  If
    no extensions are given all extensions will be served (usually
    anything but ``.py`` and ``.psp`` will be served as a static
    file). Default: ``[]``.
``UseCascadingExtensions``:
    If False, WebKit will give a ``404 Not Found`` result if there is
    more than one file that could potentially match.  If True, then
    WebKit will use the ``ExtensionCascadeOrder`` setting to determine
    which option to serve.  Default: ``True``.
``ExtensionCascadeOrder``:
    A list of extensions that WebKit will choose, in order, when files
    of the same basename but different extensions are available.  Note
    that this will have no effect if the extension is given in the
    URL.  Default: ``[".psp", ".py", ".html"]``.
``FilesToHide``:
    File patters to protect from browsing.  This affects all requests,
    and these files cannot be retrieved even when the extension is
    given explicitly.  Default: ``[".*", "*~", "*bak", "*.tmpl",
    "*.pyc", "*.pyo", "*.config"]``.
``FilesToServe``:
    File patterns to serve from exclusively.  If the file being served
    for a particulary request does not match one of these patterns an
    ``HTTP 403 Forbidden`` error will be return.  This affects all
    requests, not just requests with autodetected extensions.  If set
    to ``[]`` then no restrictions are placed.  Default: ``[]``.
``SessionModule``:
    Can be used to replace the standard WebKit Session module with
    something else.  Default: ``Session``
``SessionStore``:
    This setting determines which of the three session stores is used
    by the application: ``File``, ``Dynamic`` or ``Memory``.  The
    ``File`` store always gets sessions from disk and puts them back
    when finished.  ``Memory`` always keeps all sessions in memory,
    but will periodically back them up to disk.  ``Dynamic`` is a good
    cross between the two, which pushes excessive or inactive sessions
    out to disk.  You can choose your own session store module as well.
    Default: ``Dynamic``.
``SessionStoreDir``:
    If ``SessionStore`` is set to ``File`` or ``Dynamic``, then this
    setting determines the directory where the files for the individual
    sessions will be stored.  The path is interpreted as relative to the
    working directory (or WebKit path, if you're not using a working
    directory), or you can specify an absolute path.  Default: ``Sessions``.
``SessionTimeout``:
    Determines the amount of time (expressed in minutes) that passes
    before a user's session will timeout.  When a session times out,
    all data associated with that session is lost.  Default: ``60``.
``IgnoreInvalidSession``:
    If False, then an error message will be returned to the user if
    the user's session has timed out or doesn't exist.  If True, then
    servlets will be processed with no session data.  Default: ``True``.
``UseAutomaticPathSessions``:
    If True, then the app server will include the session ID in the
    URL by inserting a component of the form ``_SID_=8098302983`` into
    the URL, and will parse the URL to determine the session ID.  This
    is useful for situations where you want to use sessions, but it
    has to work even if the users can't use cookies.  If you use
    relative paths in your URLs, then you can ignore the presence of
    these sessions variables.  The name of the field can be configured
    with the setting ``SessionName``.  Default: ``False``.
``UseCookieSessions``:
    If True, then the app server will store the session ID in a cookie
    with the name set in ``SessionName``, which is usually ``_SID_``.
    Default: ``True``.
``SessionCookiePath``:
    You can specify a path for the session cookie here. ``None`` means
    that the servlet path will be used, which is normally the best choice.
    If you rewrite the URL using different prefixes, you may have to
    specify a fixed prefix for all your URLs. Using the root path '/'
    will always work, but may have security issues if you are running less
    secure applications on the same server. Default: ``None``.
``SecureSessionCookie``:
    If True, then the app server will use a secure cookie for the session
    ID if the request was using an HTTPS connection.  Default: ``True``.
``MaxDynamicMemorySessions``:
    The maximum number of dynamic memory sessions that will be
    retained in memory.  When this number is exceeded, the least
    recently used, excess sessions will be pushed out to disk. This
    setting can be used to help control memory requirements,
    especially for busy sites.  This is used only if the
    ``SessionStore`` is set to ``Dynamic``.  Default: ``10000``.
``DynamicSessionTimeout``:
    The number of minutes of inactivity after which a session is
    pushed out to disk.  This setting can be used to help control
    memory requirements, especially for busy sites.  This is used only
    if the ``SessionStore`` is set to ``Dynamic``.  Default: ``15``.
``SessionPrefix``:
    This setting can be used to prefix the session IDs with a string.
    Possible values are ``None`` (don't use a prefix), ``"hostname"``
    (use the hostname as the prefix), or any other string (use that string
    as the prefix).  You can use this for load balancing, where each
    Webware server uses a different prefix.  You can then use mod_rewrite_
    or other software for load-balancing to redirect each user back to the
    server they first accessed.  This way the backend servers do not
    have to share session data.  Default: ``None``.

    .. _mod_rewrite: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html

``SessionName``:
    This setting can be used to change the name of the field holding
    the session ID.  When the session ID is stored in a cookie and there
    are applications running on different ports on the same host, you
    should choose different names for the session IDs, since the web
    browsers usually do not distinguish the ports when storing cookies
    (the port cookie-attribute introduced with RFC 2965 is not used).
    Default: ``_SID_``.
``ExtraPathInfo``:
    When enabled, this setting allows a servlet to be followed by
    additional path components which are accessible via HTTPRequest's
    ``extraURLPath()``.  For subclassers of ``Page``, this would be
    ``self.request().extraURLPath()``.  Default: ``False``.
``UnknownFileTypes``:
    This setting controls the manner in which WebKit serves "unknown
    extensions" such as .html, .css, .js, .gif, .jpeg etc.  The default
    setting specifies that the servlet matching the file is cached in memory.
    You may also specify that the contents of the files shall be cached
    in memory if they are not too large.

    If you are concerned about performance, use mod_rewrite_ to avoid
    accessing WebKit for static content.

    The ``Technique`` setting can be switched to ``"redirectSansAdapter"``,
    but this is an experimental setting with some known problems.

    Default::

        {
            'ReuseServlets': True, # cache servlets in memory
            'Technique': 'serveContent', # or 'redirectSansAdapter'
            # If serving content:
            'CacheContent': False, # set to True for caching file content
            'MaxCacheContentSize': 128*1024, # cache files up to this size
            'ReadBufferSize': 32*1024 # read buffer size when serving files
        }

Caching
-------

``CacheServletClasses``:
    When set to False, the AppServer will not cache the classes that
    are loaded for servlets.  This is for development and debugging.
    You usually do not need this, as servlet modules are reloaded if
    the file is changed.  Default: ``True`` (caching on).
``CacheServletInstances``:
    When set to False, the app server will not cache the instances that
    are created for servlets.  This is for development and debugging.
    You usually do not need this, as servlet modules are reloaded and
    cached instances purged when the servlet file changes.
    Default: ``True`` (caching on).
``CacheDir``:
    This is the name of the directory where things like compiled PSP
    or Kid templates are cached.  Webware creates a subdirectory for
    every plug-in in this directory.  The path is interpreted as relative
    to the working directory (or WebKit path, if you're not using a working
    directory), or you can specify an absolute path.  Default: ``Cache``.
``ClearPSPCacheOnStart``:
    When set to False, the app server will allow PSP instances to
    persist from one AppServer run to the next.  If you have PSPs that
    take a long time to compile, this can give a speedup.  Default:
    ``False`` (cache will persist).

Errors
------

``ShowDebugInfoOnErrors``:
    If True, then uncaught exceptions will not only display a message
    for the user, but debugging information for the developer as
    well.  This includes the traceback, HTTP headers, form fields,
    environment and process ids.  You will most likely want to turn
    this off when deploying the site for users.  Default: ``True``.
``IncludeFancyTraceback``:
    If True, then display a fancy, detailed traceback at the end of
    the error page.  It will include the values of local variables in
    the traceback.  This makes use of a modified version of
    ``cgitb.py`` which is included with Webware.  The `original
    version`__ was written by Ka-Ping Yee.  Default: ``False`` (off).

    __ http://web.lfw.org/python/

``EnterDebuggerOnException``:
    If True, and if the AppServer is running from an interactive
    terminal, an uncaught exception will cause the AppServer to
    enter the debugger, allowing the developer to call functions,
    investigate variables, etc.  See python debugger (pdb) docs for
    more information.  You will certainly want to turn this off when
    deploying the site.  Default: ``False`` (off).
``FancyTracebackContext``:
    The number of lines of source code context to show if
    IncludeFancyTraceback is turned on.  Default: ``5``.
``UserErrorMessage``:
    This is the error message that is displayed to the user when an
    uncaught exception escapes a servlet.  Default: ``"The site is
    having technical difficulties with this page. An error has been
    logged, and the problem will be fixed as soon as possible. Sorry!"``
``ErrorLogFilename``:
    The name of the file where exceptions are logged.  Each entry
    contains the date and time, filename, pathname, exception name and
    data, and the HTML error message filename (assuming there is one).
    Default: ``Logs/Errors.csv``.
``SaveErrorMessages``:
    If True, then errors (e.g., uncaught exceptions) will produce an
    HTML file with both the user message and debugging information.
    Developers/administrators can view these files after the fact, to see
    the details of what went wrong.  These error messages can take a
    surprising amount of space.  Default: ``True`` (do save).
``ErrorMessagesDir``:
    This is the name of the directory where HTML error messages get
    stored.  The path is interpreted as relative to the working directory
    (or WebKit path, if you're not using a working directory), or you
    can specify an absolute path.Default: ``ErrorMsgs``.
``EmailErrors``:
    If True, error messages are e-mailed out according to the
    ErrorEmailServer and ErrorEmailHeaders settings.  You must also set
    ``ErrorEmailServer`` and ``ErrorEmailHeaders``.  Default: ``False``
    (false/do not email).
``EmailErrorReportAsAttachment``:
    Set to True to make html error reports be emailed as text with an
    html attachment, or False to make the html the body of the message.
    Default: ``False`` (html in body).
``ErrorEmailServer``:
    The SMTP server to use for sending e-mail error messages, and, if
    required, the port, username and password, all separated by colons.
    Default: ``'localhost'``.
``ErrorEmailHeaders``:
    The e-mail headers used for e-mailing error messages.  Be sure to
    configure ``"From"``, ``"To"`` and ``"Reply-to"`` before turning
    ``EmailErrors`` on.  Default::

        {
            'From':         'webware@mydomain,
            'To':           ['webware@mydomain'],
            'Reply-to':     'webware@mydomain',
            'Content-type': 'text/html',
            'Subject':      'Error'
        }
``ErrorPage``:
    You can use this to set up custom error pages for HTTP errors and any
    other exceptions raised in Webware servlets.  Set it to the URL of a
    custom error page (any Webware servlet) to catch all kinds of exceptions.
    If you want to catch only particular errors, you can set it to a dictionary
    mapping the names of the corresponding exception classes to the URL to
    which these exceptions should be redirected.  For instance::

       {
            'HTTPNotFound': '/Errors/NotFound',
            'CustomError':  '/Errors/Custom'
       }

    If you want to catch any exceptions except HTTP errors, you can set it to::

        {
            'Exception':     '/ErrorPage',
            'HTTPException': None
        }

    Whenever one of the configured exceptions is thrown in a servlet, you
    will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding error page servlet.
    More specifically defined exceptions overrule the more generally defined.
    You can even forward from one error page to another error page unless
    you are not creating loops.  In an ``HTTPNotFound`` error page, the servlet
    needs to determine the erroneous URI with ``self.request().previousURI()``,
    since the ``uri()`` method returns the URI of the current servlet, which
    in the error page itself.  When a custom error page is displayed, the
    standard error handler will not be called.  So if you want to generate
    an error email or saved error report, you must do so explicitly in your
    error page servlet.  Default: ``None`` (no custom error page).
``MaxValueLengthInExceptionReport``:
    Values in exception reports are truncated to this length, to avoid
    excessively long exception reports.  Set this to ``None`` if you
    don't want any truncation.  Default: ``500``.
``RPCExceptionReturn``:
    Determines how much detail an RPC servlet will return when an exception
    occurs on the server side.  Can take the values, in order of increasing
    detail, ``"occurred"``, ``"exception"`` and ``"traceback"``.  The first
    reports the string ``"unhandled exception``", the second prints the actual
    exception, and the third prints both the exception and accompanying
    traceback.  All returns are always strings.  Default: ``"traceback"``.
``ReportRPCExceptionsInWebKit``:
    True means report exceptions in RPC servlets in the same way as
    exceptions in other servlets, i.e. in the logfiles, the error log,
    and/or by email.  False means don't report the exceptions on the
    server side at all; this is useful if your RPC servlets are
    raising exceptions by design and you don't want to be notified.
    Default: ``True`` (do report exceptions).

Logging
-------

``LogActivity``:
    If True, then the execution of each servlet is logged with useful
    information such as time, duration and whether or not an error
    occurred.  Default: ``True``.
``ActivityLogFilenames``:
    This is the name of the file that servlet executions are logged to.
    This setting has no effect if ``LogActivity`` is False. The path can
    be relative to the WebKit location, or an absolute path.
    Default: ``"Logs/Activity.csv"``.
``ActivityLogColumns``:
    Specifies the columns that will be stored in the activity log.
    Each column can refer to an object from the set:
    [application, transaction, request, response, servlet, session]
    and then refer to its attributes using "dot notation".
    The attributes can be methods or instance attributes and can be
    qualified arbitrarily deep.  Default: ``['request.remoteAddress',
    'request.method', 'request.uri', 'response.size', 'servlet.name',
    'request.timeStamp', 'transaction.duration',
    'transaction.errorOccurred']``.

AppServer.config
================

``Host``:
    The IP address at which the application server will listen for requests.
    Use an empty string (or ``0.0.0.0``) to listen on all local network
    interfaces, or a specific address if you don't want to listen on all of them.
    You should consider the security implications of allowing external access.
    Default: ``localhost`` (``127.0.0.1``).
``EnableAdapter``:
    Whether the application server should listen for requests from the adapter.
    You'll want this on unless you decide to use the built-in HTTP server.
    Default: ``True``.
``AdapterPort``:
    The port the application server listens to for requests from the adapter.
    You cannot point a browser to this port.  You may wish to change this if
    you have another application running at this port, or if you are running
    more than one AppServer they must each be listening at a different port.
    Default: ``8086``.
``EnableMonitor``:
    Whether the application server should listen for monitor service requests.
    Monitor is a minimal service that accepts a simple protocol and returns a
    value indicating the status of the server. If you enable this, a separate
    monitoring program such as ``Monitor.py`` can provide additional assurance
    that the application server continues running at all times.
    Default: ``False``.
``MonitorPort``:
    The port for the monitor service.  You cannot point a browser to this port.
    You may wish to change this if you have another application running at this
    port, or if you are running more than one AppServer.  Default: ``8085``.
``EnableHTTP``:
    Whether the built-in HTTP server shall be activated.  The server will listen
    on the port specified by the ``HTTPPort`` setting.  Default: ``True``.
``HTTPPort``:
    The port the built-in HTTP server listens on.  You can point a web browser
    to this port.  Default: ``8080``.
``PidFile``:
    When the AppServer starts up, the process ID will be written into this file.
    The location is relative to the working directory (or WebKit path, if you're
    not using a working directory), or you can specify an absolute path.
    Default: ``appserver.pid``.
``AddressFiles``:
    When the AppServer starts up, the server address (IP address and port)
    of the adapter handler and other handlers will be written into files with
    this name, ``%s`` being replaced by the name of the respective handler.
    The location is relative to the working directory (or WebKit path, if you're
    not using a working directory), or you can specify an absolute path.
    Default: ``%s.address``.
``PluginDirs``:
    When the application server starts up, it looks in these locations for
    plugins.  Each plugin is a subdirectory of its own.  By default WebKit looks
    in the ``Webware/`` directory (``..``) for plugins -- several of which are
    shipped with Webware.  Default: ``[".."]``.
    See `Creating Plugins`__ for information on creating your own plug-ins.

    __ Developing.html#creatingplugins

    The advantage of a plug-in directory is that you can add new plug-ins to
    the app server simply by dropping them into the  directory; no additional
    configuration is necessary.
``PlugIns``:
    Loads the plug-ins from the given locations when starting the AppServer.
    You must add a directory to the list for every plug-in you use --
    ``PlugInDirs`` is usually easier.  Default: ``[]``.
``PrintConfigAtStartUp``:
    If True, prints configuration to console at startup.  Default: ``True``.
``Verbose``:
    If True, then additional messages are printed while the AppServer
    runs, most notably information about each request such as size and
    response time.  Default: ``True``.
``StartServerThreads``:
    The number of threads in the request handler thread pool that will
    be created when the application server starts.  Default: ``10``.
``MinServerThreads``:
    The minimum number of threads in the request handler thread pool.
    This makes sure that always some threads are available immediately,
    even when there had been no activity for a long time.  Default: ``5``.
``MaxServerThreads``:
    The maximum number of threads in the request handler thread pool,
    and therefore, the maximum number of concurrent requests that can
    be served.  Unless you have a serious load on a high end machine,
    the default is generally sufficient.  Default: ``20``.
``CheckInterval``:
    The number of virtual instructions after which Python will check
    for thread switches, signal handlers, etc.  This is passed directly
    to ``sys.setcheckinterval()``.  Benchmarks have shown 100 to give a
    worthwhile performance boost with higher values resulting in
    little gain.  Default: ``100``.
``RequestQueueSize``:
    The size of the queue for request handlers that is worked off by the
    server threads.  A size of zero is interpreted as two times the maximum
    number of worker threads, which has proven to be a reasonable number.
    Default: ``0`` (``2*MaxServerThreads``).
``RequestBufferSize``:
    Buffer size used for reading incoming socket requests.  Default: ``8192``.
``ResponseBufferSize``:
    Buffer size for the output response stream.  This is only used when a
    servlet has set ``autoFlush`` to True using the ``flush()`` method of
    the Response.  Otherwise, the whole response is buffered and sent in one
    shot when the servlet is done.  Default: ``8192``.
``AutoReload``:
    Enables the AutoReloadingAppServer module.  This module is designed
    to notice changes to source files, including servlets, PSP's templates,
    or changes to the Webware source files, and reload the server as
    necessary to pick up the changes.

    This uses the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) module specified in the setting
    ``UseFAMModules`` if available.  You can also specify several modules to
    check them in the given order (the default is ``gamin _fam`` for using
    python-gamin__ or python-fam__).  Otherwise, if no FAM module is specified
    or installed, or when ImportSpy has been disabled by setting ``UseImportSpy``
    to False, it resorts to polling.  The polling interval in seconds can be set
    with the ``AutoReloadPollInterval`` setting which defaults to 1 second.

    By default, ``AutoReload`` is set to ``False``.
