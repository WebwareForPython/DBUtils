This is a framework for testing WebKit end-to-end by using the built-in http 
server.  The module AppServerTest contains a TestCase base class which 
starts/stops the appserver in a separate process, and allows the test case
to check whether certain output produced by the appserver (currently this has 
not been tweaked/tested to run under Win32, but this should be straightforward).

Test cases will probably want to use a client-side web testing framework
(possibly webunit @ http://mechanicalcat.net/tech/webunit) for making requests and testing responses.


To run all tests:

$ python Test.py


To run specific test cases, pass one or more names of package/module names
on the command line which contain the test cases to be run.

$ python Test.py Basic.Test
testAppServerStarts (Basic.Test.TestBasicFunctionality) ... ok
