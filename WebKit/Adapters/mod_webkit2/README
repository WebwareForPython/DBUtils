This is a native Apache 2.2 module for communicating with the Webware WebKit
AppServer (you can find a module for Apache 1.3 in the mod_webkit1 directory).

ATTENTION: The Makefile included here is for a standard built from source
Apache2 install. You may need to make some modifications to get it running
on some Linux distributions with prepackaged Apache2 packages.
This is a DSO only module at this time. Not because it must be so, but
because I haven't adjusted the Makefile for static building. If you
prefer static Apache modules, just follow the Apache directions for building.
Note that you must have apxs installed (usually contained in apache2-devel)
and that on some Linux distributions this is called apxs2.

There are two source files, mod_webkit.c and marshal.c.

Ordinarily Apache only makes the username available to WebKit for
password protected pages, keeping the password secret. See the
Makefile on how to let mod_webkit pass that information anyway.

To build, just run 'make'. The Makefile uses apxs for the building and
installing, so you'll need to have that installed. If you're running an
RPM based distribution, it's usually included in apache-devel. Also, the
Makefile assumes apxs is in your path. If it's not, you'll need to adjust
the Makefile so that APXS points to the full path to apxs.

To install, run 'make install', and hope for the best. In my brief testing,
make install put the module in the right place, but didn't get the LoadModule
directive right. If you would rather be safe than sorry, run 'make', then
copy the resulting mod_webkit.so to your Apache2 module directory. Then modify
httpd.conf to load the module.

To build and install on Windows, you can use the make.bat batch file with the
free Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and Server 2003 Platform SDK.
For your convenience, a pre-compiled mod_webkit.dll for 32bit Windows XP
is already included in this directory which you can just place it into your
Apache modules directory under the name mod_webkit.so.

To enable this module for serving WebKit content, just set the handler for
a directory to 'webkit-handler'. Then inform the module where the appserver
is running using the WKServer configuration directive. It takes two arguments,
the host and then the port that the AppServer is running on.

My httpd.conf looks like this:
-----------------------------------------------------
LoadModule webkit_module modules/mod_webkit.so

<Location /WK>
WKServer localhost 8086
SetHandler webkit-handler
</Location>
-----------------------------------------------------

You can also set Apache to direct PSP files to the AppServer, regardless of
where they are located. The following configuration settings will do that:

AddType text/psp .psp
AddHandler psp-handler .psp

You'll need to have set a server wide WKServer directive for this to work.
You do that by giving a WKServer directive outside of any directory or
location blocks. Also, the default WKServer settings are 'localhost' and
'8086', so if that is what you are using (it's the default for WebKit),
you don't even need to have a WKServer directive anywhere.

I've included a sample configuration in apache.conf.

That's it for now.
