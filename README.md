DBUtils is a suite of tools providing solid, persistent and pooled connections
to a database that can be used in all kinds of multi-threaded environments
like Webware for Python or other web application servers. The suite supports
DB-API 2 compliant database interfaces and the classic PyGreSQL interface.
