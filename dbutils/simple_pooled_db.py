"""SimplePooledDB - a very simple DB-API 2 database connection pool.

Implements a pool of threadsafe cached DB-API 2 connections
to a database which are transparently reused.

This should result in a speedup for persistent applications
such as the "Webware for Python" AppServer.

For more information on the DB-API 2, see:
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/
For more information on Webware for Python, see:
    https://webwareforpython.github.io/w4py/

Measures are taken to make the pool of connections threadsafe
regardless of whether the DB-API 2 module used is threadsafe
on the connection level (threadsafety > 1) or not.  It must only
be threadsafe on the module level (threadsafety = 1).  If the
DB-API 2 module is threadsafe, the connections will be shared
between threads (keep this in mind if you use transactions).

Usage:

The idea behind SimplePooledDB is that it's completely transparent.
After you have established your connection pool, stating the
DB-API 2 module to be used, the number of connections
to be cached in the pool and the connection parameters, e.g.

    import pgdb  # import used DB-API 2 module
    from dbutils.simple_pooled_db import PooledDB
    dbpool = PooledDB(pgdb, 5, host=..., database=..., user=..., ...)

you can demand database connections from that pool,

    db = dbpool.connection()

and use them just as if they were ordinary DB-API 2 connections.
It's really just a proxy class.

db.close() will return the connection to the pool, it will not
actually close it.  This is so your existing code works nicely.

Ideas for improvement:

* Do not create the maximum number of connections on startup
already, but only a certain number and the rest on demand.
* Detect and transparently reset "bad" connections.
* Connections should have some sort of maximum usage limit
after which they should be automatically closed and reopened.
* Prefer or enforce thread-affinity for the connections,
allowing for both shareable and non-shareable connections.

Please note that these and other ideas have been already
implemented in in PooledDB, a more sophisticated version
of SimplePooledDB.  You might also consider using PersistentDB
instead for thread-affine persistent database connections.
SimplePooledDB may still serve as a very simple reference
and example implementation for developers.
